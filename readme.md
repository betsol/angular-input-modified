# angular-input-modified

![Bower](https://img.shields.io/bower/v/angular-input-modified.svg)


This Angular.js module adds additional properties and methods to the `ngModel` and `ngForm` controllers,
as well as CSS classes to the underlying form elements
to provide end-user with facilities to detect and indicate changes in form data.

This extra functionality allows you to provide better usability with forms.
For example, you can add decorations to the form elements that are actually changed.
That way, user will see what values has changed since last edit.

Also, you can reset an entire form or just a single field to it's initial state
(cancel all user edits) with just a single call to the `reset()` method or
lock new values (preserve new state) just by calling overloaded `$setPristine()`
method.


## Demos and examples

Please see [the demos][gh-pages] hosted on our GitHub Pages or
[open them locally][faq-local-demos].

Also, feel free to play with our [Plunk][plunk]!


## Decorations and animation

This module adds `ng-modified` and `ng-not-modified` CSS classes (names are customizable) to the input fields to indicate their state.
Use them in your CSS to decorate input fields. You can combine multiple classes in the same selector.
For example, use this convenient CSS selector to decorate modified elements as valid:

```css
/** Decorating only modified inputs as valid */
input.ng-valid.ng-modified {
    border-color: green;
}
```

This way end user will see what elements were actually changed.

This module also supports animations if `ngAnimate` module is available.


## Installation

### Install library with bower

`bower install --save angular-input-modified`


### Add library to your page

``` html
<script src="/bower_components/angular-input-modified/dist/angular-input-modified.js"></script>
```

You should use minified version (`angular-input-modified.min.js`) in production.


### Add dependency in your application's module definition

``` javascript
var application = angular.module('application', [
  // ...
  'ngInputModified'
]);
```


## Usage

Please see our [demos and examples](#demos-and-examples) as well as [API documentation](#api).


### Form initialization

Starting from version `2.0.0` form must be synchronously initialized during
controller execution. If you need some data to be fetched prior to form
initialization — the best approach is to
[resolve](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute/provider/$routeProvider)
this data using your router.

However, if you really need to re-initialize form after controller execution —
please use the approach shown in this demo:
[Delayed Initialization][demo-delayed-init].


### Excluding some fields

Input modified module provides you with the ability to control which input elements
will exhibit modifiable behavior and which will not.

By default all form fields in your application will support modifiable behavior,
after input modified module is added to the application. You can control this
via `enableGlobally()` and `disableGlobally()` methods of the `inputModifiedConfigProvider`.
This gives you the overall top-level switch to control modifiable behavior.

Also, we provide you with special directive called `bsModifiable` that allows you
to control which fields will support the behavior. It gives you are more granular
control over your forms. This directive works in a recursive manner and can be applied
to any HTML element. For example, you can apply it to an entire form:
`<form name="myForm" bs-modifiable="true">` in order to enable modifiable behavior
on all it's fields.

`bs-modifiable` attribute can be set to `true` or to `false`, depending on what
you are trying to achieve.

You can exercise the **exclusion** policy by excluding only specific fields or you
can exercise the **inclusion** policy by disabling the behavior globally and then
adding modifiable behavior only to the required forms or form fields.
It's all up to you!

Please see [the special demo][demo-excluded-elements].


## API

### inputModifiedConfigProvider

Use this provider to configure behavior of this module.
Every setter of this provider supports methods chaining.
See example:

```javascript
angular.module('Application', ['ngInputModified'])
  .config(function(inputModifiedConfigProvider) {
    inputModifiedConfigProvider
      .disableGlobally()
      .setModifiedClassName('my-changed')
      .setNotModifiedClassName('my-clear')
    ;
  })
;
```


| Method                                       | Description
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
| enableGlobally()                             | Enables modifiable behavior globally for all form elements (this is default)
| disableGlobally()                            | Disables modifiable behavior globally for all form elements
| setModifiedClassName({string} className)     | Provides CSS class name that will be added to modified elements. `ng-modified` is the default one
| setNotModifiedClassName({string} className)  | Provides CSS class name that will be added to unmodified elements. `ng-not-modified` is the default one


### ngModel


| Property     | Type       | Description
|--------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------
| masterValue  | `mixed`    | Initial value of the form field
| modified     | `boolean`  | Flag that indicates whether the form field was modified


| Method          | Description
|-----------------|------------------------------------------
| reset()         | Resets input value to it's initial state
| $setPristine()  | Makes form field pristine by preserving current value as a new master value


### ngForm


| Property                 | Type       | Description
|--------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------
| modified                 | `boolean`  | Flag that indicates whether the form is modified
| modifiedCount            | `integer`  | The number of modified form fields
| modifiedModels           | `array`    | The list of modified model controllers
| modifiedChildFormsCount  | `integer`  | The number of modified child forms
| modifiedChildForms       | `array`    | The list of modified child form controllers


| Method          | Description
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------
| reset()         | Resets all input fields of the form to their initial states
| $setPristine()  | Makes form pristine by making all child forms and form fields pristine


### bsModifiable

This directive can be applied to any element on the page. All descendant form
fields (recursively) will respect it.


| Attribute      | Type      | Description
|----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| bs-modifiable  | `string`  | Either "true" or "false", see ["excluding some fields" chapter](#excluding-some-fields)

## FAQ

### How do I access demos locally?

Node.js must be installed in your OS.

- Install [Gulp][gulp] by running `npm install -g gulp`
- clone the repo
- run `gulp demo` in the repo's root directory
- open `http://localhost:8888/`


## Developer guide

Fork, clone, create a feature branch, commit, create a PR.

Run:

- `npm install && bower install` to initialize the project
- `gulp build` to re-build the dist files
- `gulp demo` to run local webserver with demos
- `gulp demo-deploy` to deploy GitHub Pages

Do not add dist files to the PR itself.
We will re-compile the module manually each time before releasing.


## Support

If you like this library consider to add star on [GitHub repository][repo-gh].

Thank you!
